# Take-Online-Payment
This Python project generates QR codes for online payments via UPI using various payment platforms like PhonePe, Paytm, and Google Pay. The user inputs their UPI ID, and the script generates and displays QR codes for each payment service, allowing easy transactions. The QR codes are saved as images for future use.
